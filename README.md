Clove is a social media desktop application that was developed back in 2008. It was a competitor application to [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/), and
[HoutSuite](https://hootsuite.com/), and other social media platforms that aggregated all your content into one place. This project created by two guys: [Tim](https://twitter.com/neutyp) did the design work, and
[Craig](http://craigjefferds.com) did all the development.

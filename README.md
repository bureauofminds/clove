Clove is a social media desktop application that was developed from 2008 to 2010. It was a competitor application to [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/), and
[HootSuite](https://hootsuite.com/), and other social media platforms that aggregated all your content into one place. This project was created by two guys: [Tim Erickson](https://neutyp.com/) designed the application's interface, and
[Craig Condon](http://crcn.io/) wrote all code for the application. It was written on Adobe AIR, a cross-platform runtime environment that compiled ActionScript to `.air` files which could be easily installed like other Mac or Windows applications. 

The original version of Clove was targetted solely for power users to manage their various social network accountsâ€” however, Clove would later grow to be used as an application to deliver branded, curated content within enterprise environments and niche interest-based communities. While not all branded versions of the application are included, there are included 2 of the publicly available sports themed applications. 

The first, Scout it Out, allowed users to self-select players from their Fantasy Football team, and recieve real-time updates, videos and stats for all players. The second allowed users to follow their favorite teams in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, providing real-time updates and scores.

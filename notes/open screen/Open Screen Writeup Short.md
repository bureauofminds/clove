Clove is a social media discovery platform. Clove allows users to aggregate and interact with their social media. Clove is built on an open SDK, allowing anyone to add functionality to the app. Furthermore, Clove is social network independent, meaning it reaches far beyond Twitter, Facebook, and Myspace. Any social network with an API can be added to Clove.

Clove is more than just a content aggregator. We are developing branded versions for companies that want to immerse themselves in social media. With a branded version of Clove, the brand has the ability to provide curated content feeds to their readers through Clove. These verticalized versions of Clove will allow consumers to wade through the noise of social media and find specific content they are interested in.

However, Clove goes beyond being a consumer application, and has many potential uses for corporations and brands to build custom applications on the Clove Core.
Clove's Core architectures let you:

- quickly deploy to the mobile phone market and the web,
- build apps at 1/3rd of the time and cost than if started from scratch,
- create plugins for multiple devices without rewriting code.

We chose Flash & AIR because:

- It allowed us to build on PC, Mac, and Linux at once,
- Was the most mature of the platforms we explored,
- We later saw the potential to reach other platforms such as mobile and web.

We will use the grant money to help expand Clove and it's social media reach. Specifically, this means hiring on a developer to:

- work with the Clove SDK,
- build features and plugins for new social networks,
- expand our reach to mobile platforms.

We are excited about the possibilities of Flash Lite & 10.1 running on multiple mobile devices. Particularly we are looking at:

- Android based phones (Nexus One, and Droid Incredible, among others),
- the Nokia N900,
- other phones powerful enough to run Clove.

We are looking to hit these platforms in 4 months time.

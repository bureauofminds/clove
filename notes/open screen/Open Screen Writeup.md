Clove is a social media discovery platform. We are building an application that allows users to aggregate and interact with their social media. Clove is built on an open SDK for development, which allows anyone to add functionality to the application. Furthermore, Clove is social network independent, meaning it reaches far beyond Twitter, Facebook, and Myspace. Any social network with an API can be added to Clove.

Clove will serve as more than just a content aggregator. We plan to develop branded versions for companies that want to immerse themselves into social media. With a branded version of Clove, the brand has the ability to provide any content they want to their readers through Clove. 

Feeds may include a fan page via Facebook, a specific Twitter search, a blog RSS feed, etc. In addition, the company will have access to statistics showing how users are interacting with the branded version. For example; what feeds they’re deleting or what content they’re interacting with the most. 

Each branded version will be deployed across multiple screens including the mobile version of clove, the web version, and the desktop version. This will ensure users have the ability to read the same feeds anywhere with few limitations.

These verticalized versions of Clove will allow consumers to wade through the noise of social media and find specific content they are interested in. For example, we are building a home living version of Clove that provides in-detail information about everything you may need to know if you are looking to remodel your kitchen. From photos for inspiration, to what materials, and who your contractor may be.


However, Clove goes beyond being a consumer application, and has many potential uses for corporations and brands.

As well, the Clove Core can be adapted to other platforms and screens, such as the mobile phone market and the web. Brands can work with us to build custom applications on the Clove Core that interact with social media and any API or database. The Clove Core has been architected to allow developers to create plugins for multiple devices and screens without rewriting their code. This multi-platform flexibility means brands can deploy applications to multiple screens in 1/3rd of the time and cost if they had started from scratch. We have been talking with companies that are already building similar applications that interact with social media. 


We chose to build on Flash and AIR because it allowed us to build on three platforms at once (PC, Mac, Linux) and was the most mature of platforms we explored. We later saw the potential to reach other platforms such as mobile and web. 

We will use the grant money to help expand Clove and it’s social media reach. Specifically, this means hiring on a developer to work with the Clove SDK and build features and plugins for new social networks. As well, expanding our reach to mobile platforms.

We are excited about the possibilities of Flash Lite and Flash 10.1 running on multiple mobile devices. Many of the companies we have spoken with have expressed interest in having the same powerful aggregation tools (available in Clove for the Desktop) running on multiple mobile phones as well. Particularly we are looking at Android based phones (Nexus One, and Droid Incredible, among others), the Nokia N900 and other phones powerful enough to run Clove. We are looking to hit these platforms in 4 months time.


We launched public beta the first week of May, and the application is available directly to consumers by download at Cloveapp.com. Branded versions of Clove will be marketed and distributed by the supporting brands.

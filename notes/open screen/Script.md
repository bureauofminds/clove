### Welcome to Spice Apps

We build web and desktops applications that you'll find helpful, wether you’re a business owner, run a website, or are just a user of social networks.

Clove, our first application, is a social media management program. Take control of your social networks, eliminate the clutter, and make use of tools that aren’t available with other social networking applications.

For site owners, Ginger will be our second app based on our Bridge framework. It will be a web based video player you can quickly deploy and adopt to different scenarios.

Next, you’ll be able to use Basil, a web based audio player supporting icecast, shoutcast and mp3.

We are also working on a interactive video production engine, and a dynamic self-hosted photo gallery.

Are you a developer? All of our applications are extendable, with SDKs. We invite you to build plugins to extend the functionality of our applications!

If you’d like to learn more about our spices, please watch our video demonstrations. Or, you can take a peek at the plugin gallery to see what others have built on our platform.


### Welcome to Clove

Clove is one of the most powerful social management desktop applications. You can easily follow and interact with all your social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, your blog RSS subscriptions and more.

Getting started with Clove is an easy three step process. Step one, download Clove. It works with any operating system, Windows, Mac & Linux. Step two, Clove prompts you to log-in to your social networks and content feeds. You’ll only have to do this once. Step three, organize your content to you liking, setting up folders for work, home and hobbies.

Check out our features like threaded discussions, multiple accounts, viewing attachments within Clove, and for the first time—reading new social network while you’re offline.

And, if you’re a developer, Clove is the first extendable, open desktop social app with an SDK. We invite you to help us expand it.


### About Spice Apps

Spice Apps LLC was founded in late 2009, and consists of 3 founders; Craig Condon, Tim Erickson, and Kim Garretson. Spice Apps core beliefs revolve around creating applications that solve personal problems, are open and extendable, and are very user friendly.

Craig has developed a computer language called Bridge at age 17, and started contracting work at age 16.

Kim was the Director of Emerging Media and liaison to the venture capital community at Best Buy.

Tim has been working as a contract designer sine the age of 16 and has about a dozen new ideas each day. If not working at Spice Apps, Tim is working on one of his many side projects.

Craig and Tim met in High School, after recognizing that their individual talents as a developer and designer (respectively) would make a very smart team. They both have a passion for creating applications that solve personal problems they have encountered.

Craig met Kim (who takes on an advisory role in the partnership) through a family acquaintance. He has since worked with Craig and Tim to connect them with local business interests, and help create buzz.

All of our projects start as an answer to a problem we’ve had personally. We looked around for an app that allowed us to manage our social networks in an elegant manner. We found an array of applications, but nothing that quite worked. For example, we found plenty of applications that worked solely with twitter, but not any of the other social networks we are a part of.

On the flip side, we found apps like tweetdeck, that managed a several social networks at once, but did so in a very hard to use manner. All of the apps felt very “walled garden”, not allowing much customization or extension. So we decided to build an application that was social network independent, and very easy to use.

Well, we have several other “spices”, or applications, in the works, but Clove is currently the most promising (and what we are spending our time on!)

Craig and Tim created what we call “Ginger” a web based video player. It is self hosted, open source, and built on a framework that allows for easy extendability.

Say for instance, you wanted to build a abc.com like platform of viewable tv shows. However, you need to be able to show ads on the player every 15 minutes. With Ginger, you can do this with only a few lines of code.

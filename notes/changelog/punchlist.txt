1. Open downloading an update of clove, I am prompted for plugin updates... the plugin updates should be either bundled with clove upon an update, or automatically installed
3. Use Mainbox/SettingsCorner.png instead of the generated glow you have now (column prefs)
4. On a default install, if we're going to separate the facebook and twitter columns to two groups we need to:
	a. put the twitter group first
	b. Name the groups (Twitter, Facebook)
	c. Put icons next to the groups
	d. put icons on each column
8. Loads of padding issues that I'll need to show in person
12. I'm confused as to what the facebook status feed is showing? Is it the News Feed, or the Live Feed? What is being hidden?
17. View support forums link should be changed to http://spiceapps.com/forum/
18. Shouldn't be able to more than one empty column
22. Error windows should not be above all other windows, it should have the regular window rules
26. padding on the character count in the poster is not right
27. You shouldn't be able to have more than 1 poster window
